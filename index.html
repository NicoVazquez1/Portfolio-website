              <p>
                This project aims to streamline the process of recording fruit weight, revenue generated, worker
                payments, tray
                quantity, client information, and delivery type in a blueberry field. I myself worked in such a field a
                few years ago
                and witnessed firsthand how slow the process was and how it could be improved.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, the way it worked was as follows: every 2 hours, a truck would enter the field ready to be filled
                with the fruit.
                The workers would approach the truck one by one and submit their trays filled with fruit for weighing.
                The data would
                be recorded on paper, and at the end of the working day, all the calculations would be done to determine
                the payments
                for each worker, the total amount of fruit collected, and the generated revenue.
              </p>
              <p>
                Understanding this, the idea of creating an app came to mind. With the app, all the data could be
                recorded and
                automatically processed, eliminating the need for manual calculations.
              </p>
              <p>
                I proposed this idea to the field owner, and he liked it. Here is the design:

            <div class="container-fluid">
              <br>
              <p>I also created the entity-relationship, in this, one worker or 'trabajadores' can have multiples
                'entregas', and 'entregas' can have only one 'despacho' or truck, etc...

            <div class="container-fluid">
              <p>Then I created the users stories describing the problems to be solved and the budget estimating the

            <div class="container-fluid">
              <p>The next step was creating the connection. For that, I used Entity Framework. Then,
                I implemented security by creating the JWT and making the necessary
                configurations.
                Afterwards, I created the endpoints, connected to the database in the services folder, and whenever
                there's
                a need
                for a business operation, I handle it through the NegocioService class, which contains all the
                business
                logic.</p>

              <br>
              <p>In this other test I created a delivery of fruit, asigning the workers ID, the amount of kilos and the

            <p><strong>Cannon</strong> is a 3D game where you shoot barrels that appear on the screen using your cannon.
              In the game</p>
            <p>I created this video game to put my programming skills into practice and to learn Unity engine. a started
              with an old version and I manage to make the cannon to shoot the targets with different types of ammo,
              sounds and particle effect, but as the project start to grow it became kind of messy, so a started a new
              version using some of the code used before, here is how the project look before
            </p>
            <img src="img/cannon/cannon-oldVersion.png" alt="">
            <p>And this is the new version, as you can see, I also change the models so it can be more fluent and make
              the terrain nicer</p>
            <img src="img/cannon/cannonPortada.png" alt="">
            <p>this is what I have done so far in 2 days. For now, I going to show the types of bullets the player can shoot, 
              you can switch between three types of ammunition:</p>
            <p><strong>Standar Bullet:</strong> a single bullet ideal for precision. </p>
            <img src="img/cannon/cannon_normalBullet.gif" alt="" class="gif">
            <p><strong>Shotgun Shot:</strong> multiple bullets with dispersion, ideal for quickly hitting multiple
              nearby
              targets.

            <img src="img/cannon/cannon_shotgun.gif" alt="" class="gif">
            <p><strong>Freeze Bullet:</strong> explosive ammunition ideal for hitting multiple targets with a single

            <img src="img/cannon/cannon_freezeBullet.gif" alt="" class="gif">
            <p>Next Steps: implement scoring system, HUD, Loot system depending of different barrel,

            <p>
              Sector 7-G is a video game that emerged from a game jam with the theme of "the calm before the storm." It
              involves
              taking on the role of a technician at a nuclear station and trying to prevent the reactor from exploding,
              even though
              the ending is inevitable (end screen note: this was my idea). It was developed in 3 days as the final
              project for the
              game art design course, in which I served as a tutor for composition and music production. However, upon
              learning that
              I could participate, I joined the group and programmed the button mini-game, as well as composed a small
              jazz piece on
              the piano. Additionally, I do not appear in the credits screen, but I am mentioned on the page on itch.io.
            </p>
            <p>This is the minigame I coded, basicly when you reproduce the right pattern it give 7 seconds more and a green text apprears, but if you fail then you keep running out of time </p>
            <img src="img/sector7g/sector7g_trim.gif" class="gif" alt="">
            <p>
              As is often the case with such projects and due to the participants' inexperience, the game didn't come
              out polished.
              The button mini-game lacks proper feedback. Later on, I took the project and polished it myself, but my
              version
              doesn't include the music from the other team members. Nevertheless, it is more enjoyable, and I also
              improved my jazz
              piece.</p>
