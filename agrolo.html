        <h2>Agrolo - Optimizing the Fruit Harvesting Process</h2>

        <p>Note: Normally, I program in English, but I also wanted to teach others who don't speak English, which is why
            I chose
            the Spanish language for this project.</p>
        <p>Let's talk about something useful. This project aims to streamline the process of recording fruit weight, revenue
        generated, worker payments, tray quantity, client information, and delivery type in a blueberry field. I myself
        worked in such a field a few years ago and witnessed firsthand how slow the process was and how it could be
        improved
        with this app. So, I proposed the idea to the field owner, and he liked it. That's when I created the design:

        <p>Working with WordPress helped me improve my design skills. I also created the entity-relationship diagram:

        <p>The next step was creating the connection. For that, I used Entity Framework, and to be honest, I thought it
            would be
            more difficult. Then, I implemented security by creating the JWT and making the necessary configurations.
            Afterwards, I created the endpoints, connected to the database in the services folder, and whenever there's
            a need
            for a business operation, I handle it through the NegocioService class, which contains all the business
            logic.</p>

        <p>Finally, I conducted tests using Postman:</p>

        <p>Currently, the project is running smoothly on the server. For the interface, I'm going to train another
            person in the
            basics of programming to assist me in its development. Unfortunately, the project is on hold due to
            financial issues
            with the client. However, there is hope that the project will resume if the business model changes. There is
            a risk
            involved, but I like taking risks.</p>
