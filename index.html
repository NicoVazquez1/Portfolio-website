              <p><strong>Skills:</strong> MVC arquitecture | Database and interface design | SOLID </p>
              <p>
                This project aims to streamline the process of recording fruit weight, revenue generated, worker
                payments, tray
                quantity, client information, and delivery type in a blueberry field. I myself worked in such a field a
                few years ago
                and witnessed firsthand how slow the process was and how it could be improved.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, the way it worked was as follows: every 2 hours, a truck would enter the field ready to be filled
                with the fruit.
                The workers would approach the truck one by one and submit their trays filled with fruit for weighing.
                The data would
                be recorded on paper, and at the end of the working day, all the calculations would be done to determine
                the payments
                for each worker, the total amount of fruit collected, and the generated revenue.
              </p>
              <p>
                Understanding this, the idea of creating an app came to mind. With the app, all the data could be
                recorded and
                automatically processed, eliminating the need for manual calculations.
              </p>
              <p>
                I proposed this idea to the field owner, and he liked it. Here is the design:

            <div class="container-fluid">
              <br>
              <p>I also created the entity-relationship, in this, one worker or 'trabajadores' can have multiples
                'entregas', and 'entregas' can have only one 'despacho' or truck, etc...
              </p>

            </div>

            <div class="container-fluid">
              <p>Then I created the users stories describing the problems to be solved and the budget estimating the
                amount of hours of work</p>
            </div>

            <div class="container-fluid">
              <p>The next step was creating the connection. For that, I used Entity Framework. Then,
                I implemented security by creating the JWT and making the necessary
                configurations.
                Afterwards, I created the endpoints, connected to the database in the services folder, and whenever
                there's
                a need
                for a business operation, I handle it through the NegocioService class, which contains all the
                business
                logic.</p>
              <p>I based my architecture on MVC</p>

            <div class="container-fluid">
              <p>Finally, I conducted tests using Postman</p>
              <p>In this first test a created a new truck which is ready to recive the fruit</p>
              <img src="img/agrolo/init.png" class="gif">
              <br>
              <p>In this other test I created a delivery of fruit, asigning the workers ID, the amount of kilos and the
                amount of trays
              </p>
              <p>The system take the number of trays and multiply by it's weight, then that value it substracted to the
                amount of kilograms and that is the total amount of kilograms delivered, after that the system take the
                payments by kilogram and multiply it by the amount of kilos depending on the type of buisness in which
                is related to, in this case is "Bulk", finally, I devided that value by the workers corresponding
                payments and assing it to the corresponding worker by the id</p>
              <img src="img/agrolo/entrega.png" class="gif">
              <p>All this data is stored in the database</p>
              <p>And then, I deliver all the fruit load from the truck, in this function I assign the exact moment in
                which the truck departs
              </p>
              <img src="img/agrolo/envio.png" class="gif">
              <p>here's the database, the money generated by the last truck</p>

              <p>Currently, the project is running smoothly on the server. For the interface, I'm going to train
                another
                person in the
                basics of programming to assist me in the development of the frontend interface. The project is still in
                development due to financial reason with the client I am still waiting for the requirements, anyways the
                project is going be complete </p>

            <p>
              In the features folders we create our Gherkin files and then we use this option and specflow automaticaly

            <p><strong>Cannon</strong> is a 3D game where you shoot barrels that appear on the screen using your cannon.
              In the game</p>
            <p>I created this video game to put my programming skills into practice and to learn Unity engine. a started
              with an old version and I manage to make the cannon to shoot the targets with different types of ammo,
              sounds and particle effect, but as the project start to grow it became kind of messy, so a started a new
              version using some of the code used before, here is how the project look before
            </p>
            <img src="img/cannon/cannon-oldVersion.png" alt="">
            <p>And this is the new version, as you can see, I also change the models so it can be more fluent and make
              the terrain nicer</p>
            <img src="img/cannon/cannonPortada.png" alt="">
            <p>this is what I have done so far in 2 days. For now, I going to show the types of bullets the player can
              shoot,
              you can switch between three types of ammunition:</p>
            <p><strong>Standar Bullet:</strong> a single bullet ideal for precision. </p>
            <img src="img/cannon/standar.png" alt="" class="gif">
            <p><strong>Shotgun Shot:</strong> multiple bullets with dispersion, ideal for quickly hitting multiple
              nearby
              targets.
            </p>
            <img src="img/cannon/shotgun.png" alt="" class="gif">
            <p><strong>Freeze Bullet:</strong> explosive ammunition ideal for hitting multiple targets with a single
              blow.

            <img src="img/cannon/cannon_lastMuestra.gif" alt="" class="gif">
            <p>Next Steps: implement scoring system, HUD, Loot system depending of different barrel,
              Improve the performance, Improve the gameplay, Fix bugs </p>

            <p>
              Sector 7-G is a video game that emerged from a game jam with the theme of "the calm before the storm." It
              involves
              taking on the role of a technician at a nuclear station and trying to prevent the reactor from exploding,
              even though
              the ending is inevitable (end screen note: this was my idea). It was developed in 3 days as the final
              project for the
              game art design course, in which I served as a teacher for composition and music production. However, upon
              learning that
              I could participate, I joined the group and programmed the button mini-game, as well as composed a small
              jazz piece on
              the piano. Additionally, I do not appear in the credits screen, but I am mentioned on the page on
              <a href="https://horror-sounds.itch.io/sector-7-g">itch.io</a>.
            </p>
            <p>This is the minigame I coded, basicly when you reproduce the right pattern it give 7 seconds more and a
              green text appears</p>
            <img src="img/sector7g/Correct.png" class="gif" alt="">
            <p>But if you fail then you keep running out of time and a red text appears</p>

            <p>
              As is often the case with such projects and due to the participants' inexperience, the game didn't come
              out polished.
              The button mini-game lacks proper feedback. Later on, I took the project and polished it myself, but my
              version
              doesn't include the music from the other team members. Nevertheless, it is more enjoyable, and I also
              improved my jazz
              piece.</p>

              <p>Acuarium is a Unity project in which I put one of my songs, and then a series of 3D objects appear
                following the
                frequencies of the music. Meanwhile, the player is in the middle of an "Acuarium" watching the music
                "flow".</p>

              </p>
              <p>PubliEdicto was the final project of the Egg FullStack course. It consisted of users uploading an edict
                on the
                web, which could then be quoted and published. However, we didn't have good teamwork, and the project
                was
                completed by me with its basic functionality. After that, we didn't continue the project.</p>

              <p>This was a landing page for the promotion of gas engineer services. It reached the first place for
                Mendoza center
                thanks to SEO work done by me. However, after some time, the project didn't work in term of SEO, so it
                was dropped.</p>
              <p>It had some characteristic like, a 3D button of some typewriter effects</p>

              <p>This was a website for the promotion of a veterinary. It was made with a team of Forjadores.online. The
                SEO was
                not done by me. I made the landing page, login and register pages, as well as other configurations for
